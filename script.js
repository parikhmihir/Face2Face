	<h2 align="center">About Face2Face</h2>
	Too much use of social media is creating a negative impact on the lives of people.
	People are shifting from realism. Whenever people became idle, they either 
	invite negative thoughts or resort to social media doing unnecessary stuff. 

	Socialism is not improved by just chatting on social media, but by participating 
	in various social events.

	So, this app <em>Face2Face</em> tries to connect people with similar hobbies and opinions. 
	Whenever a registered user feels lonely he can update his status. The system will 
	search for the user who is also lonely with a similar hobby or likings within a 
	nearby location. If both agree to meet at a location, they can choose a 
	specific timing.
	
	A user can also create an event. All the registered users will be able to see 
	the list of events and participate in any one of them.`
